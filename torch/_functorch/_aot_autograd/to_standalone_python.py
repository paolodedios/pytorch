"""Lower a GraphModule to a self-contained Python module via AOTAutograd + Inductor.

This is the AOT half of the backend contract behind ``torch.compiler.precompile``:

    python_code, cache = compile_to_python(gm, example_inputs)

``inductor.compile_to_python`` produces only the inner Inductor ``call`` (kernels
for the post-AOTAutograd dense graph). This module wraps that with the prelude /
epilogue (input-mutation reflection, output-alias regen, subclass wrap/unwrap,
...) by COMPOSING AOTAutograd's own codegen'd runtime-wrapper source -- captured
during compile -- rather than reimplementing it. Every wrapper (the orchestration and
any chain wrappers: subclass / dedup / functionalized-RNG) is spliced verbatim as a real
top-level ``def``, with its closed-over globals hoisted to module-scope assignments, so
the module reads as ordinary code. Cross-wrapper references, the inner ``call`` chain,
public helpers, and baked metadata objects (reconstructed as source -- see
``_emit_value``) are wired by name; a guard rejects the rare case where a wrapper def
name or hoisted global would collide with another top-level name (a sibling wrapper or
an inner-module binding) rather than silently rebinding one.
The result is a standalone module exposing ``call(flat_inputs) -> outputs`` that
runs on its own (JIT-compiling kernels); ``cache`` is an opaque acceleration (or
None).

Baked metadata is emitted as plain Python source (no pickle / base64 blobs), so the
generated module is fully auditable and exec'ing it never invokes ``pickle.loads``.
A leaf that cannot be expressed as source raises NotImplementedError rather than
falling back to an opaque embedding.

Contract note: the standalone ``call`` deliberately substitutes ``nullcontext`` / a
no-op for the runtime's first-invocation context and profiler prologue, dropping the
cold-start custom-op aliasing analysis and the profiler prologue -- both diagnostics
with no effect on numerics (see the generated-call emission site). One caveat: that
dropped first-invocation custom-op aliasing analysis can itself RAISE under
``config.error_on_custom_op_aliasing`` (default on in CI), so a graph whose custom op
violates the aliasing contract runs SILENTLY in the standalone artifact where the
eager / compiled path would error -- an intentional trade-off, not a numerics bug.

# ======================================================================
# WHAT IS GOING ON HERE: composing AOTAutograd's runtime wrappers as source
# ======================================================================
#
# AOTAutograd does not hand back a single flat function. The dense graph Inductor
# compiles (the inner ``call``) is only the arithmetic core; around it AOTAutograd
# wraps a prelude/epilogue that does what the core cannot express: reflecting input
# mutations back onto the caller's tensors, regenerating outputs that alias an input
# or each other, wrapping/unwrapping tensor subclasses, de-duplicating aliased
# inputs, and threading functionalized RNG state. At runtime AOTAutograd emits each
# wrapper as Python *source*, exec's it (the chokepoint is _compile_and_exec_source
# in codegen.py), and the resulting function runs while closing over a
# globals dict supplied in-process -- i.e. a wrapper is (source text) +
# ({local_name: live_object}).
#
# The objects a wrapper closes over come in a few kinds:
#   - public runtime helpers the codegen'd source references (e.g. increment_version,
#     gen_alias_from_base, _unwrap_tensoralias, mark_dynamo_propagated_dynamic_indices,
#     the CUDARngStateHelper staticmethods) -- ordinary importable objects;
#   - the inner Inductor ``call`` that the chain ultimately invokes;
#   - sibling captured wrappers -- the next link of the runtime chain (subclass /
#     dedup / functionalized-RNG, whose body calls the link it wraps), plus the
#     orchestration's output-alias and mutation epilogue helpers, which it closes
#     over directly by reference;
#   - per-graph metadata baked at compile time (e.g. a ViewMetaSequence for alias
#     regen, tensor-subclass metadata) -- live objects with no import path.
#
# We do NOT reimplement any of this. We CAPTURE AOTAutograd's exact codegen'd wrapper
# source together with the (pre-exec) globals dict each wrapper closed over: a
# thread-local sink in codegen.py records one GeneratedSource per wrapper.
# The capture is triggered for free -- the inner ``inductor.compile_to_python``
# re-enters AOTAutograd (under no_grad, the inference path), and that re-entry is what
# emits, and so what we record, the wrappers.
#
# THE COMPOSITION PROBLEM. To turn a captured wrapper into a real top-level ``def`` in
# the standalone module we splice its source verbatim. But that source refers to each
# global by the LOCAL ALIAS AOTAutograd happened to choose (e.g. ``compiled_fn`` for
# the inner call), not by any importable name. So for each ``{name: obj}`` in the
# captured globals dict we emit a top-level binding ``name = <source for obj>`` (see
# _emit_inline) -- except when the resolved expression already IS that module-scope
# name (an import, or ``torch``), which needs no binding. The hard part is the right-
# hand side: given only a live object, produce source that reproduces it. That requires
# RECOGNIZING what the object is, the job of _resolve_global and the id-keyed
# structures it consults, in order:
#   - inner_call_id         -> the inner ``call`` becomes ``_inner_call``
#   - fn_id_to_name         -> a sibling wrapper's fn becomes that wrapper's own name
#   - _known_helper_table() -> an importable helper becomes (import, expr)
#   - anything else: reconstruct field-by-field as source (_emit_value), or raise.
# Recognition is by id() (object identity), not value-equality: for "is this the EXACT
# object the wrapper closed over," == is the wrong tool (functions don't compare by
# value, and an equal-but-different object would mis-resolve). Value-equality IS used,
# but later and for a different job -- _emit_value round-trip-checks reconstructed
# metadata (rebuilt == obj) before trusting it. Every hoisted name is _reserve'd: a
# collision with a sibling wrapper's name or an inner-module binding fails loudly
# rather than silently rebinding.
#
# WHY THIS IS SAFE ACROSS PROCESSES AND MACHINES. Every id() above is consulted ONLY
# here, during composition, in the process that just ran the compile -- where all the
# candidate objects (helpers, the inner call, sibling wrappers) are simultaneously
# alive, held by the GeneratedSource records and the captured globals dicts, so no
# address can be freed and reused mid-pass. Nothing the composer emits carries an id()
# value, a live object, or any thread-local capture state: it emits only import lines,
# ``name = expr`` bindings, and verbatim def source (the inner Inductor source is
# likewise spliced as text). Grep the GENERATED module and there is no ``id(`` to
# find. By the time the user holds the Python, all the process/thread-local state the
# composer leaned on is gone; what ships is imports + name bindings + verbatim code.
# Load it on another machine with the same torch version and the imports resolve by
# name and the bindings reconstruct -- identity was a compile-time recognition device,
# never a serialized artifact (live tensors / pickle / base64 blobs are rejected
# outright rather than embedded).
#
# So the one genuine cross-machine contract is not id() but that the *names* the
# artifact imports still resolve on load. Helpers are emitted as either ``import
# torch`` (the torch module and stable public paths, e.g.
# torch.autograd.graph.increment_version) or an import from the single small surface
# standalone_runtime.py (for the AOTAutograd-area internals -- plus CUDARngStateHelper,
# re-exported there for import-ordering -- whose locations are not themselves a stable
# contract). That file's IDENTITY CONTRACT -- re-exports must preserve object id --
# exists purely so the COMPOSER's id-lookup keeps matching; it is a compile-time
# requirement, and the runtime artifact has no id dependency of its own.
